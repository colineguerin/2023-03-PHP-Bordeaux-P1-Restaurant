# RESTAURANT

This is my first real web development collaborative project. This website was coded from scratch with HTML, CSS and Javascript in 2 weeks by a team of 4 students for a fictional client: a restaurant called Mille Sabords.

It includes, in both mobile and desktop versions:
- a nav bar with a dynamic boat icon
- description cards
- a carousel of images
- a dynamic card to view the restaurant's menu
- a booking form
- a contact section with a map

To view it, just clone the repository on your favorite editor and visit the page on your localhost.
